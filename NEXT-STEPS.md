## Quick Start for Development

1. Ensure PostgreSQL is installed and running
2. Configure the `.env` file with proper credentials
3. Run `npm run setup` to initialize the database
4. Start the development server with `npm run dev`
5. Access the application at http://localhost:5500

## Common Issues & Troubleshooting

### Email Delivery Issues
- Make sure to use an App Password for Gmail if 2FA is enabled on the Gmail account
- Check the EMAIL_USER and EMAIL_PASS in the .env file
- Verify network connectivity to smtp.gmail.com:465

### Database Connection Issues
- Ensure PostgreSQL service is running
- Check the database credentials in the .env file
- Make sure the specified database exists or can be created
- Verify that the PostgreSQL user has the necessary permissions

### 2FA Not Working
- Check that email delivery is working (run `npm run test-email`)
- Verify that the temp_admin_registration table was created successfully
- Check for any database errors in the console logs
